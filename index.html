        <p class="plinux">I have a strong foundation in Linux, a critical skill for DevOps and cloud infrastructure. My experience includes mastering essential Linux commands for file management, user permissions, and process monitoring. I've also developed a solid understanding of Linux networking, from configuring IP addresses and firewalls to managing network interfaces.

            In addition, I am proficient in accessing and managing virtual machines through SSH, which enables secure communication between machines in a networked environment. I have hands-on experience with server configuration, setting up and managing web servers like Apache2 and Nginx, ensuring reliable and optimized hosting environments. This knowledge has provided me with a versatile skill set that supports my DevOps ambitions, allowing me to work across different server and cloud environments efficiently.</p>

            <p class="AWS">I have a foundational understanding of AWS (Amazon Web Services), one of the leading cloud platforms used globally for scalable infrastructure solutions. My experience with AWS includes working with core services such as EC2 for launching and managing virtual servers, S3 for secure and scalable storage solutions, and Lambda for deploying serverless applications.

                I've also explored AWS's VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) to manage networking, configure private and public subnets, and ensure secure access to cloud resources. My hands-on experience with RDS (Relational Database Service) allows me to work with databases in a cloud environment, optimizing application data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I’m familiar with IAM (Identity and Access Management) for managing user roles and securing AWS resources.</p>

                 </div>
         
                 <p class="HTML">I have a solid foundation in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the backbone of web development. Through my hands-on projects, I've gained proficiency in structuring web pages using HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, tables, lists, and forms. This allows me to create clean, well-organized websites that serve as the basis for responsive and interactive web applications.

                    My HTML expertise includes using semantic tags to improve accessibility and search engine optimization, while also maintaining good coding practices. I have experience working with multimedia elements and embedding external content like videos and maps to enhance user experience. Additionally, I understand the importance of properly formatting HTML documents for maintainability and collaboration with other front-end technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
                    
                    Whether creating static pages or interactive layouts, my HTML knowledge is a key part of my toolkit in web development, allowing me to build the structure and content for modern websites and web applications</p>

                      <p class="CSS">I have a strong grasp of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which I use to bring visual appeal and functionality to web pages. My knowledge of CSS enables me to design responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and polished user experience.

                        I am experienced in utilizing CSS properties for styling elements, including colors, fonts, margins, paddings, and positioning. Through my work, I've learned to organize styles using methodologies like BEM (Block Element Modifier), ensuring that my CSS code remains modular and easy to maintain. I also incorporate advanced techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for efficient layout designs, creating complex layouts with minimal code.
                        
                        Additionally, I focus on enhancing user interaction through hover effects, transitions, and animations, bringing websites to life. My understanding of media queries helps me ensure that designs remain responsive, while I leverage CSS variables and custom properties for cleaner, more flexible code.
                        
                        With CSS, I combine creativity and precision to develop visually engaging, user-friendly websites.</p>

            </div>
    
            <p class="TS">I have developed a solid understanding of TypeScript, a powerful, statically typed extension of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability. Through my work, I have learned how TypeScript's static typing system helps in catching errors early in the development process, resulting in more reliable and scalable applications.

                I am proficient in using TypeScript features such as data types, interfaces, and type aliases to define the structure and behavior of objects and variables. Additionally, I have experience with generics, allowing me to create reusable and flexible components in my code. My understanding of TypeScript modules and namespaces helps me organize and manage large codebases, while ensuring maintainability.
                
                Working with TypeScript has also improved my ability to build and manage complex front-end applications, particularly when working with frameworks like Next.js. I use TypeScript's compiler to ensure that the code is error-free and conforms to specified types, which ultimately results in better developer productivity and fewer runtime errors.
                
                With TypeScript, I am able to write more predictable, clean, and well-structured code, which is essential for building robust web applications.</p>
